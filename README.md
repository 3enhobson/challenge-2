# challenge-2

## Description

This project is the first rendition of my portfolio. It includes a link to my first challenge that I completed for this bootcamp course and links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and twitter. this project wasbuilt from scratch using HTML and CSS. I built this project to gain a greater understanding of how to build something that I can show to future potential employers. I learned that you have to be very specific with how you layout the HTML so it make it easier to style it with CSS.
